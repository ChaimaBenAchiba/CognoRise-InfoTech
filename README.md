## Overview

This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset consists of features extracted from mammogram images.

## Algorithms Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Features extracted from mammogram images.
  
- Labels indicating tumor type (malignant or benign).
  
## How It Works
-Data Collection and Preparation:

-Selection Techniques: Identify relevant features crucial for classification.


-Algorithms:

Employ: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

Training: Models learn patterns and relationships between features and tumor classifications (malignant or benign).

-Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Evaluate models using accuracy and precision.

Cross-validation: Ensure robustness and generalizability of models through validation techniques.

Selection of the Best Model:

Performance: Choose the model with the highest metrics for predicting breast cancer tumor classification.

Serialization: Save the best model for deployment or further analysis.
